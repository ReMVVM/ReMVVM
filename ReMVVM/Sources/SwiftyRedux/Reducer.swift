 Provides pure function that creates new state based on the action and current state. It is associated with specific Action type.

 #Example
     struct LoginReducer: Reducer {

             let user = User(firstName: action.firstName, lastName: action.lastName)

/**
 Type erasured reducer. Used to make composition of pure reducers into more complicated state reducers.

 #Examples

 - Convert Reducer to AnyReducer
    ```
    let anyLoginReducer = LoginReducer.any // AnyReducer<UserState>
    ```

 - Compose reducers for the same State
    ```
    let userReducer = AnyReducer(with: [LoginReducer.any, LogoutReducer.any]) // AnyReducer<UserState>
    ```

 - Create reducer for complex state that contains couple of 'subStates'
    ```
     let applicationReducer = AnyReducer { state, action -> ApplicationState in

        let userReducer = AnyReducer(with: [LoginReducer.any, LogoutReducer.any])
        // ...
        return ApplicationState(
             userState: userReducer.reduce(state: state.userState, with: action),
             favouritesState: favouriteReducer.reduce(state: state.favouritesState, with: action),

            // ...
        )
     }
    ```
